# OctoAcme — Project Management at a Glance

Purpose
A concise entry point to OctoAcme's project management processes. This README helps new teammates quickly understand how we run projects, who's responsible for what, and where to find detailed process docs.

Quick lifecycle
- Initiation — validate the opportunity and define success (one-pager).
- Planning — turn the one-pager into a prioritized backlog and release plan.
- Execution & Tracking — build, test, review, and monitor progress (project board + CI).
- Release & Deployment — ship with safety checks, rollout, and rollback plans.
- Retrospective & Continuous Improvement — capture learnings and create measurable action items.

Team rhythm
- Daily standups for short syncs & blockers
- Weekly delivery syncs and PM+PdM reviews
- Sprint demos/reviews and periodic stakeholder updates

Core roles
- Project Manager (PM): coordinates delivery, risks, and communications
- Product Manager (PdM): defines outcomes and prioritizes work
- Developers / QA: implement, test, and maintain quality
- Stakeholders & Sponsors: provide input and approvals

Key artifacts (and where to find them)
- Project one-pager / charter
- Roadmap & release plan
- Backlog & acceptance criteria
- Risk register, retrospective notes, and release notes

Risk & communication summary
Keep a simple risk register, review it at weekly syncs, and use the project README or release doc as the single source of truth for status. Escalation: Team → PM → Product Lead → Sponsor.
