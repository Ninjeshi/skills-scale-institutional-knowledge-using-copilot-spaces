# OctoAcme Project Management — Quick Start

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation! This guide provides a navigable overview of how we run projects, from initial idea to production release.

## Purpose

These docs help teams deliver customer value through clear ownership, iterative delivery, and data-informed decisions. Whether you're a new teammate or looking for a refresher, start here to understand our approach.

## Project Lifecycle

1. **Initiation**: Define the problem, stakeholders, and high-level timeline → [Details](octoacme-project-initiation.md)
2. **Planning**: Break work into shippable increments, identify dependencies, and create a backlog → [Details](octoacme-project-planning.md)
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build, test, review, and track progress toward milestones → [Details](octoacme-execution-and-tracking.md)
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production with quality gates and rollback plans → [Details](octoacme-release-and-deployment.md)
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements → [Details](octoacme-retrospective-and-continuous-improvement.md)

## Team Rhythm

- **Daily standups** (15 min): progress, blockers, dependencies
- **Weekly delivery sync**: progress updates and flagged risks
- **Sprint demos**: showcase work at each milestone
- **Monthly stakeholder updates**: transparency and alignment

## Core Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: coordinates delivery, schedules, risks, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: defines outcomes, prioritizes backlog, measures success
- **Developers**: implement features and collaborate on design and testability
- **QA/Testing Engineer**: validates quality and acceptance criteria, ensures release readiness
