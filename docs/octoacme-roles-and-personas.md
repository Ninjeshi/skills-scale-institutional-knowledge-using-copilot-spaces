## How these personas are used in the exercise

- Use these persona definitions to frame scenarios and sample interactions in the Skills Exercise.
- Each persona can be used as a persona prompt for Copilot Spaces to shape role-specific guidance.
- The interactions section for each role demonstrates how cross-functional collaboration works in practice.
- Reference these personas when creating project plans, onboarding new team members, or clarifying responsibilities in complex projects.

## Cross-Functional Collaboration Best Practices

Effective collaboration across these personas is essential for project success. For detailed checklists, onboarding guidance, and communication best practices, see the [Cross-Role Collaboration & Onboarding Guide](octoacme-collaboration-and-onboarding.md).

Key principles include:

- **Clear accountability**: Each role has distinct responsibilities, reducing overlap and confusion
- **Regular communication**: Established cadences (daily standups, weekly syncs, monthly reviews) ensure alignment
- **Shared context**: All roles contribute to and benefit from shared documentation and project artifacts
- **Early involvement**: Bringing in Security, UX, QA, and Support early prevents costly late-stage changes
- **Continuous feedback**: Regular retrospectives and cross-role reviews drive process improvements
